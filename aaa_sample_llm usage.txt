Let’s build a conceptual sample application using a **Large Language Model (LLM)** tailored for a life insurance provider like **AAA Life**, focusing on three core functions: **underwriting**, **claims processing**, and **customer retention**.

## 🏗️ Sample LLM-Powered Insurance App: “LifeLens AI”

### 🔧 Architecture Overview
```
[User Interface] → [LLM Orchestrator] → [MCP Client] → [MCP Servers / APIs]
                                 ↘︎
                          [Data Lake / CRM / Policy DB]
```

## 1️⃣ Underwriting Assistant

### 🎯 Goal:
Speed up risk assessment by analyzing unstructured medical records and applications.

### 💡 LLM Capabilities:
- Summarize **Attending Physician Statements (APS)** and flag risk indicators
- Extract key terms from PDFs or scanned documents
- Generate underwriting narratives for human review

### 🧪 Sample Prompt:
```python
prompt = f"""
Analyze the following APS and summarize key health risks, medications, and lifestyle factors.
Document: {aps_text}
"""
response = llm.generate(prompt)
```

---

## 2️⃣ Claims Processor

### 🎯 Goal:
Automate first notice of loss (FNOL), fraud detection, and document triage.

### 💡 LLM Capabilities:
- Classify claim types from emails or call transcripts
- Detect inconsistencies or missing documentation
- Summarize claim history for adjusters

### 🧪 Sample Prompt:
```python
prompt = f"""
Summarize this claim submission and flag any missing documents or inconsistencies.
Claim Notes: {claim_text}
"""
response = llm.generate(prompt)
```

---

## 3️⃣ Retention & Engagement Engine

### 🎯 Goal:
Boost customer retention by identifying churn risks and personalizing outreach.

### 💡 LLM Capabilities:
- Analyze sentiment from support chats or surveys
- Generate personalized renewal messages
- Recommend upsell/cross-sell products based on life stage

### 🧪 Sample Prompt:
```python
prompt = f"""
Review this customer’s interaction history and generate a personalized retention email.
History: {interaction_log}
"""
response = llm.generate(prompt)
```

---

## 🧠 Bonus: Integration with AAA Life Systems
- 🔗 Connect to **Salesforce** or **AWS DynamoDB** for policy data
- 🧾 Use **Amazon Textract** for document parsing
- 🛡️ Apply **Amazon Comprehend Medical** for clinical term extraction

Would you like me to turn this into a working prototype in Python or sketch out the API endpoints for each module?
